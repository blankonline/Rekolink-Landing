        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          Rekolink SAS is a French company dedicated to building trust through verified professional skills. We're based at 
          15 rue de l'Orgerie, 35590 Saint-Gilles, France. For any privacy-related questions or concerns, you can reach us 
          directly at <a href="mailto:privacy@rekolink.com">privacy@rekolink.com</a>.

        <h2>What Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
        <p>
          When you create an account with Rekolink, we collect your email address, name, and optionally a profile photo. 
          As you build your professional profile, you can add information about your skills, work history, education, and 
          certifications. The platform is designed around recommendations, so we also store the endorsements you give and receive. 
          If you use our chat feature, we keep your messages and any files you share. For Pro subscribers, we maintain your 
          subscription status through Apple or Google's payment systems, though we don't store your full payment details.
        </p>

        <h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
        <p>
          To ensure Rekolink works smoothly, we automatically collect certain technical information. This includes details 
          about your device (like your OS version and app version), how you use different features, and crash reports if 
          something goes wrong. We also gather anonymized analytics data to understand behavior patterns and improve the 
          platform for everyone.
        </p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          Your data powers the core Rekolink experience. We use it to provide profiles, recommendations, chat functionality, 
          and AI-powered features that help you grow professionally. For Pro subscribers, we verify payments and manage premium 
          features. Security is paramount—we use your data to detect fraud and moderate harmful content, keeping the platform 
          safe for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our AI features continuously improve through machine learning, but we only train models on aggregated, anonymized 
          data—never your personal information in identifiable form. This helps us make better career suggestions, improve 
          trust scoring, and enhance the overall experience while respecting your privacy.
        </p>

        <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>We never sell your data.</strong> Your information stays private and is only shared in specific, limited circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          We work with trusted service providers who help us operate Rekolink—companies that provide hosting, analytics, and 
          AI processing. When you subscribe to Pro features, Apple or Google manages your subscription and shares basic status 
          information with us. We use third-party content moderation services to help keep the platform safe. Finally, we may 
          share data with legal authorities when required by law or to prevent harm.
        </p>
        <p>
          All our partners are required to comply with data protection laws and use your information only for the specific 
          purposes we've outlined.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Privacy Rights</h2>
        <p>
          You have complete control over your data. You can request a copy of all the information we have about you, correct 
          any inaccuracies, or ask us to delete your data entirely. If you want to take your data elsewhere, we'll provide it 
          in a portable format. You can also opt out of marketing emails at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          To exercise any of these rights, simply contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@rekolink.com">privacy@rekolink.com</a>. 
          We'll respond promptly and help you with your request.

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We keep your data as long as your account is active. If you decide to delete your account, we give you a 90-day 
          window to change your mind and restore everything. After that period, your data is permanently deleted or 
          anonymized. Some records—like financial information or abuse reports—may be kept longer to comply with legal 
          requirements.

      <section>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          We protect your data with industry-standard security measures. All information is encrypted both in transit and at 
          rest. We use strict access controls and authentication protocols, conduct regular security audits, and employ automated 
          content moderation to catch harmful material before it spreads.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we take every reasonable precaution, no system is 100% secure. We encourage you to protect your login credentials 
          and report any suspicious activity immediately.

        <h2>International Transfers</h2>
        <p>
          Rekolink operates from France, within the European Union. However, some of our service providers are located outside 
          the EU, including in the United States. When we transfer data internationally, we use Standard Contractual Clauses 
          approved by the European Commission and other safeguards to ensure your data remains protected according to EU standards.

        <h2>Age Requirement</h2>
        <p>
          Rekolink is designed for users aged <strong>16 and older</strong>. We don't knowingly collect information from anyone 
          younger than 16. If we discover that we've inadvertently collected such data, we'll delete it immediately.

        <h2>Cookies & Tracking</h2>
        <p>
          Our mobile app uses minimal tracking technology—primarily session tokens to keep you logged in and basic analytics to 
          understand how people use Rekolink. For more detailed information about our tracking practices, please see our 
          Cookie Policy.

        <h2>Updates to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          As we add new features or adapt to changing regulations, we may update this privacy policy. When we make material 
          changes, we'll notify you via email or through an in-app notification, giving you time to review the updates before 
          they take effect.
